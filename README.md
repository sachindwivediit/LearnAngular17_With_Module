This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Step 1: Install Angular CLI

If you haven't installed Angular CLI yet, run:

npm install -g @angular/cli

## Step 2: Create a New Angular Project

ng new my-angular-app

Angular 17 Tip
Since Angular 17 supports standalone components, the ng new command now defaults to a module-free architecture. If you still want to use traditional modules, you can create the project with:

ng new my-angular-app --no-standalone

## Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Directory
cd my-angular-app

## Step 4: Run the Development Server
Start the local server with:
ng serve --open
it will open default http://localhost:4200/ in your browser to see your Angular app running!
